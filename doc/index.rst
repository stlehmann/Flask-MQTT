Welcome to Flask-MQTT's documentation!
======================================

Flask-MQTT is a `Flask <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_ extension meant to facilitate
the integration of a MQTT client into your web application.
`MQTT <http://mqtt.org/>`_ is a machine-to-machine (M2M)/"Internet of Things"
(IoT) protocol which is designed as a lightweight publish/subscribe messaging
transport. It comes very handy when trying to connect multiple IoT devices with each other
or monitor and control these devices from one or multiple clients.
